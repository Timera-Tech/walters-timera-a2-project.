This is my code for my interactive drawing called "Be an artist"!!!!
## How to use "Be an Artist"
When you first run the code it is blank.
Drag the cursor onto the screen.
Hold down left click to draw with a red circle.
Hold down right click to draw with a blue rectangle.
The shapes swap colors when both are held down. You are able to draw with both shapes.
